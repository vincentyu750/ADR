# Data Storage

## Status

 Proposed local device and cloud based sotrage

## Context

- **Cloud:** Cloud based storage for user data storage, order information and analytics.
- **Offline:** Local device storage for offline functionality. 

## Decision

By having both proposed solutions for data storage will allow for the application to meet the requirements. Will need to consult costs.

## Consequences

Costs will increase as company scales. Data breachers might occur with hosting on a different platform and locally. Cloud services may go down and have to compensate incase of that matter.
