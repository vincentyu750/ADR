# Permissions

## Status

Internet access, local storage device, push notifications proposed.

## Context

- **Internet Access:** Connecting to client's end user server to synchornize user information and order data
- **Local Storage Device:** Being able to use client's device in order to store offline data for offline functions
- **Push Notifications:** Will enable client's end user device to recieve notifcations about order informations, products and future offers.

## Decision

We will implement permissions systems for the app of which will require user consent. 

## Consequences

Clients and end users may worry about user privacy info and be pushed away from the application if too many permissions are asked.
